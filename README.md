- 👋 Hi, I’m @RobbS79, but call me just Rob :)


- 👀 I’m interested in digitisation and automation of business administration processes, data analytics and data science implementation into business decisions, in form of micro services which will enable clients to manage their self-service business intelligence
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to apply machine learning methods and techniques like association rules mining and classification of customers in order to identify consumer behaviour and customer segments, with a goal to supply strategic decisions of companies, and development methods to deliver digital transformation solutions
  
- 💞️ Besides collaboration on business and economics related projects, I’m looking for participation on SW development projects, since delivery of BI solutions must be scaleable and possible to distribute on-demand through the web as a SaaS tool
  
- 📫 You can reach me on my LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertsoroka/ or via my e-mail address soroka.robert8@gmail.com
